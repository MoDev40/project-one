### 1. **Install PHP Dependencies**

Run the following command in the project directory to install the required PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

Ensure that you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed on your system.

### 2. **Set Up Environment Configuration**

-   Copy the `.env.example` file to create a `.env` file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
-   Configure the `.env` file with your application settings, such as the database credentials.

### 3. **Generate Application Key**

Generate an application key for your Laravel project:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 4. **Migrate the Database**

If the project uses a database, run migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 5. **Run the Laravel Development Server**

Start the local development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

### Checklist of Required Software

-   PHP 8.1+ (or as specified by the Laravel 10 requirements)
-   Composer
-   Node.js (if the project uses frontend assets)
-   Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc., depending on `.env`)

After completing these steps, the Laravel 10 application should be ready to run.
